              <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian team in
                limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and
                in
                Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely
                regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI)
                debut in
                December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.</p>
